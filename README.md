# Reactive Noter

A small app to create simplistic and minimalistic notes and storing them in a database.

Project made in one day as a challenge with the intention to learn new technologies ( _Redux_ and _Nest.js_ ) as fast as possible. Because of the fast paced development, some features are missing like `deleting notes` and `color changing`.

## Technologies

#### Front End

- `TypeScript`
- `React`
- `React Router`
- `Redux`
- `Material UI`

#### Back End

- `TypeScript`
- `Nest.js`
- `Prisma`

## How to try

Start by cloning both [front-end](https://github.com/RiadhAdrani/reactive-color-noter-fe) and [back-end](https://github.com/RiadhAdrani/reactive-color-noter-be) repositories, then make sure to run `npm i` for both to install dependencies. To start development, run `npm run start:dev` within the backend project directory, and `npm run start` or simply `npm start` within the backend project.
